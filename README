This is a simple daemon python class based on the code available at
http://www.jejik.com/articles/2007/02/a_simple_unix_linux_daemon_in_python/

This variant adds support for the status command.

This code is in the public domain, just like the original. Do with it as you
will, but there is no warranty as to its utility or safety. If it blows up
your house or makes your spouse cheat on you, it's not my problem.
